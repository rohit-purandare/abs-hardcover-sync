# Audiobookshelf to Hardcover Sync Tool

A simple Python CLI tool that syncs your audiobook listening progress from [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) to reading progress in [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/).

## How It Works

The tool works by:

1. **Getting your progress** from Audiobookshelf
2. **Finding matching books** in your Hardcover library using ISBN
3. **Converting percentages to pages** (e.g., 71.5% of a 496-page book = page 354)
4. **Updating your reading progress** in Hardcover

### Example
```
Syncing Project Hail Mary: 71.5% ‚Üí page 354/496
‚úì Synced: Project Hail Mary
```

## Features

- **Simple Sync**: One command to sync all your audiobook progress
- **ISBN Matching**: Finds books in your Hardcover library using ISBN
- **Progress Conversion**: Converts listening percentages to page numbers
- **Auto-Complete**: Marks books as "Read" when you're 95%+ done
- **Dry Run Mode**: See what would be synced without making changes
- **Interactive Menu**: Easy-to-use menu system
- **Cache System**: Remembers your book editions for faster syncing
- **Progress Bars**: Visual feedback during syncing
- **Parallel processing for fast syncs:**
  - Audiobookshelf API calls (book details/progress) are fetched in parallel for up to 2x speedup
  - Hardcover API status/progress updates are performed in parallel with built-in rate limiting (max 50 requests/minute, 5 workers)
  - Typical syncs are now 2‚Äì4x faster than before
- **Robust error handling and detailed logging**
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD, security scanning, and pre-commit hooks**

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Audiobookshelf server (with API access)
- Hardcover account (with API token)
- Internet connection

## Setup

### 1. Get Your API Tokens

**Audiobookshelf:**
- Go to your Audiobookshelf web interface
- Settings ‚Üí Users & Sessions ‚Üí API Tokens
- Create a new token

**Hardcover:**
- Visit [hardcover.app/account/api](https://hardcover.app/account/api)
- Copy your API token (do NOT include "Bearer " prefix)

### 2. Create Config File
```bash
cp config/secrets.env.example config/secrets.env
```

### 3. Add Your Tokens
Edit `config/secrets.env`:
```bash
# Your Audiobookshelf server
AUDIOBOOKSHELF_URL=https://your-audiobookshelf-server.com
AUDIOBOOKSHELF_TOKEN=your_audiobookshelf_api_token

# Your Hardcover token
HARDCOVER_TOKEN=your_hardcover_api_token

# Optional: Customize sync behavior
MIN_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD=5.0  # Only add to "Currently Reading" if 5%+ progress
```

### 4. Test Your Setup
```bash
python src/main.py config
```

## Usage

**Important:** Always run the CLI from the project root directory so it can find your `config/secrets.env` file:
```bash
cd /path/to/audiobookshelf-hardcover-sync
python src/main.py test
```
If you run the script from another directory, it may not find your config file and will report missing API tokens.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run with interactive menu (default)
python src/main.py

# Test your connections
python src/main.py test

# Sync your progress
python src/main.py sync

# See what would be synced (no changes)
python src/main.py sync --dry-run
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Run with menu (this is the default)
python src/main.py --interactive

# Force non-interactive mode
python src/main.py sync --no-interactive
```

### All Commands
```bash
python src/main.py sync      # Sync your progress
python src/main.py test      # Test connections
python src/main.py config    # Show your setup
python src/main.py --help    # Show all options
```

### Auto-Sync (Optional)
Set up automatic syncing with cron:
```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Sync every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/sync-tool && python src/main.py sync
```

## Docker & Containerization

- **Alpine-based image:** The official Docker image is now based on `python:3.11-alpine` for a smaller, more secure, and efficient build.
- **Healthcheck:** The Docker image and Compose setup include a healthcheck for better container monitoring and reliability.
- **Non-root user:** The container runs as a non-root user for improved security.
- **.dockerignore:** The project uses a robust `.dockerignore` to keep images small and secure by excluding unnecessary files.

### Docker Deployment

#### Using GitHub Container Registry (Recommended)

The project automatically builds and publishes a minimal, Alpine-based Docker image to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Pull the latest image (Alpine-based)
docker pull ghcr.io/rohit-purandare/audiobookshelf-hardcover-sync:latest
```

- The image is based on `python:3.11-alpine` for reduced size and attack surface.
- Includes a built-in healthcheck for container monitoring.
- Runs as a non-root user for security.
- Uses a robust `.dockerignore` to keep images lean.

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Scheduled Syncs)

```bash
# Start the sync tool in scheduled (cron) mode
docker-compose up -d
```

By default, the container will:
- Stay running in the background
- Sync your progress on the schedule you set in `config/secrets.env` (e.g., every hour)
- Restart automatically if stopped or after a reboot (due to `restart: unless-stopped`)

**To change the sync schedule:**  
Edit `config/secrets.env`:
```env
SYNC_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *   # every hour (default)
TIMEZONE=UTC              # or your preferred timezone
```

**To view logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f abs-hardcover-sync
```

**To stop the service:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Building Locally

```bash
# Build the image (Alpine-based)
docker build -t abs-hardcover-sync:alpine -t abs-hardcover-sync:latest .

# Run the container
# (mount your config and cache files as needed)
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $PWD/config/secrets.env:/app/config/secrets.env:ro \
  -v $PWD/.progress_cache.json:/app/.progress_cache.json \
  -v $PWD/.edition_cache.json:/app/.edition_cache.json \
  abs-hardcover-sync:latest
```

**Configure sync schedule in `config/secrets.env`:**
```bash
# Sync every hour (default)
SYNC_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *

# Sync every 6 hours
SYNC_SCHEDULE=0 */6 * * *

# Sync daily at 9 AM
SYNC_SCHEDULE=0 9 * * *

# Timezone
TIMEZONE=UTC
```

See [docker/DOCKER.md](docker/DOCKER.md) for detailed Docker usage instructions.

## How It Works

### Book Matching
1. **Find your book** in Hardcover using ISBN
2. **Pick the best edition** (one with page count)
3. **Convert progress** from percentage to pages

### Progress Conversion
```
pages = (percentage / 100) √ó total_pages
```
Example: 71.5% of a 496-page book = page 354

### Progress Threshold
The tool uses a minimum progress threshold to keep your "Currently Reading" list clean:

- **Above threshold** (default: 5%): Added to "Currently Reading" + progress synced
- **Below threshold**: Added to "Want to Read" + progress synced
- **0% progress**: Added to "Want to Read" + no progress sync (avoids API errors)

**Smart Status Management:**
- Books automatically move from "Want to Read" to "Currently Reading" when they cross the threshold
- Books automatically move from "Currently Reading" to "Want to Read" when they drop below the threshold
- This keeps your active reading list focused while ensuring all started books are tracked

### Smart Features
- **Progress Threshold**: Only adds books to "Currently Reading" if you've made meaningful progress (default: 5%)
- **Auto-complete**: Books 95%+ done are marked "Read"
- **Cache**: Remembers your book editions for faster syncing
- **Progress bars**: Shows you what's happening

### Cache System

The tool remembers which book editions you use to sync faster:

- **Automatic**: Saves your choices automatically
- **Persistent**: Remembers between runs
- **Manageable**: View stats or clear via menu

**Managing Cache:**
```bash
python src/main.py --interactive
# Then select "Cache management"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No ISBN found":**
- Some audiobooks don't have ISBN data
- These books are skipped automatically

**"Failed to update progress":**
- Check your Hardcover API token
- Make sure the book exists in your library

**Connection errors:**
- Check your server URLs and tokens
- Try `python src/main.py test` to verify

### Getting Help

Run with verbose logging:
```bash
python src/main.py sync --verbose
```

Check logs in `abs_hardcover_sync.log` for details.

## Security

- Your API tokens are stored locally in `secrets.env`
